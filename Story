Once upon a time in a forest there lived a monkey who resided in a berry tree, which was on the banks of a river.
In the same forest there lived a Crocodile and his wife.
One day the Crocodile rested under the tree near the banks of the river the kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits as he loved them.
